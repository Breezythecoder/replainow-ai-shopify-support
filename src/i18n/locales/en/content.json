        },
        {
          "question": "What happens when AI can't answer?",
          "answer": "The AI recognizes when a question is too complex or needs human empathy (e.g., complaints). In these cases, it automatically escalates to your team with full context. Your agent sees the entire conversation history and knows immediately what to do."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much time do I really save?",
          "answer": "With 100 tickets/day and 70% automation, you save ~17 hours/day. That equals 2.1 full-time agents. At $3,000/month per agent = $6,300/month saved. Minus ReplAInow costs ($99) = $6,201 net saved/month."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need technical know-how?",
          "answer": "No! Installation is as easy as any other Shopify app. One click install, activate widget, done. No programming, no configuration files, no technical training. If you can use Shopify, you can use ReplAInow."
        },
        {
          "question": "What about multilingual support?",
          "answer": "The AI automatically detects customer language and responds in 100+ languages. You no longer need multilingual agents ($4,500+/month per language). One German-speaking agent can operate the dashboard while AI responds in Spanish, French, Japanese, etc."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly do I see results?",
          "answer": "Immediately! After installation (60 seconds), AI is already answering customer questions. In the first week you'll see: Reduced response times (3 seconds instead of minutes), happier customers (instant answers), more relaxed team (less repetitive work)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I control the automation?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! You control the auto-send threshold (80-95%). Set it higher for conservative (more manual review) or lower for more automation. You see all AI responses in the dashboard and can always intervene."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does this work for B2B or only B2C?",
          "answer": "Both! AI works for B2C (many simple questions) and B2B (more complex requests, but repeatable patterns). B2B especially benefits from bulk-order support and technical product question automation."

        {
          "question": "What does 24/7 support with ReplAInow really cost?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Can I activate 24/7 only for peak times?",
          "answer": "ReplAInow is always 24/7. But you control WHEN AI auto-sends. Example: Set auto-send to 95% at night (only best answers), 85% during day (more automation)."

(4) Management time not tracked (10h/week = $2k/month). (5) Scaling thought linearly (but it's exponential!)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I also only PARTIALLY automate?",
          "answer": "Yes, but why? ReplAInow automates 60-80% optimally. You can increase auto-send threshold (e.g. 95%) for more manual reviews, but that increases costs again. Sweet spot: 80-90% threshold = 60-70% automation = maximum savings at high quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I need more agents again (AI doesn't work)?",
          "answer": "ReplAInow has 4.9/5 stars from 28+ merchants – it works. But: Cancel anytime (monthly). No contracts, no lock-in. If you're unsatisfied (< 1% of users), you can return to traditional. 30-day money-back guarantee."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I compare costs between different solutions?",
          "answer": "Use TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), not just monthly prices. Example: Zendesk $115/month looks cheap, but you need 3-5 agents ($9k-15k) + software = $9,115-15,115 total. ReplAInow: $99 + 1 agent ($3k) = $3,099 total. Compare TOTAL, not just software."
        },
        {
          "question": "What will support cost me in 3 years (projection)?",
          "answer": "Traditional: $180k-240k/year × 3 = $540k-720k. With ReplAInow: $40k-50k/year × 3 = $120k-150k. Savings over 3 years: $420k-570k! That's enough to open a second shop, hire 2 marketing managers, or launch new product lines."
