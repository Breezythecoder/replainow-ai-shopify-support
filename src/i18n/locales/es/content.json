        {
          "question": "How much time do I really save?",
          "answer": "With 100 tickets/day and 70% automation, you save ~17 hours/day. That equals 2.1 full-time agents. At $3,000/month per agent = $6,300/month saved. Minus ReplAInow costs ($99) = $6,201 net saved/month."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need technical know-how?",
          "answer": "No! Installation is as easy as any other Shopify app. One click install, activate widget, done. No programming, no configuration files, no technical training. If you can use Shopify, you can use ReplAInow."
        },
        {
          "question": "What about multilingual support?",
          "answer": "The AI automatically detects customer language and responds in 100+ languages. You no longer need multilingual agents ($4,500+/month per language). One German-speaking agent can operate the dashboard while AI responds in Spanish, French, Japanese, etc."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly do I see results?",
          "answer": "Immediately! After installation (60 seconds), AI is already answering customer questions. In the first week you'll see: Reduced response times (3 seconds instead of minutes), happier customers (instant answers), more relaxed team (less repetitive work)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I control the automation?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! You control the auto-send threshold (80-95%). Set it higher for conservative (more manual review) or lower for more automation. You see all AI responses in the dashboard and can always intervene."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does this work for B2B or only B2C?",
          "answer": "Both! AI works for B2C (many simple questions) and B2B (more complex requests, but repeatable patterns). B2B especially benefits from bulk-order support and technical product question automation."
