2. **Generic Design** - Looks like a template
3. **Weak CTAs** - Not compelling enough
4. **No Story Flow** - Random feature listing
5. **Trust Deficit** - Not enough social proof
6. **Color Chaos** - Too many competing colors
7. **Mobile Afterthought** - Desktop-only thinking

### Future Vision ✅
1. **Scannable** - 3-second value understanding
2. **Premium Feel** - Custom, high-end design
3. **Conversion Focused** - Every section sells
4. **Narrative Flow** - Problem → Solution → Success
5. **Trust Everywhere** - Proof at every step
6. **Refined Palette** - Purple/White/Green only

## 💡 Copy Guidelines

### Headlines
- **Benefit-first** (not feature-first)

- **Active voice** (not passive)
- **You/Your** (not we/our)

### Examples:
❌ "We offer AI-powered chat"
✅ "Turn browsers into buyers 24/7"

❌ "Advanced analytics dashboard"  
✅ "See exactly what sells (and why)"

❌ "Multilingual support"
✅ "Sell in 95+ languages instantly"

---

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

The new homepage should feel like:
1. **Apple** - Clean, premium, focused
2. **Stripe** - Developer-friendly, trusted
3. **Shopify** - Native, e-commerce focused
4. **Tesla** - Innovative, future-forward

Every pixel should either:
- Build trust
- Show value  
- Drive action
- Delight users

No exceptions.
