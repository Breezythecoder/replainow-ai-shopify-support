Focus on **MERCHANT BENEFITS**, not technical implementation.

- "Team collaboration built-in" (vs. solo agent struggle)

**Group Features by Benefit:**
- Time-saving features
- Automation features

## 📐 LENGTH GUIDELINES

**Target Length:** 1,500-2,500 words (5-8 pages)

**Allocation Suggestion:**

## 🎨 TONE & STYLE EXAMPLES

**Good Example:**
> "ReplAInow automatically imports your entire Shopify catalog in under 60 seconds. Products, orders, customers, policies - everything your AI needs to provide intelligent support. No manual setup, no configuration files, no maintenance. Install once, never configure again."

**Why It's Good:**
- Clear benefit (60 seconds vs. hours)
- Specific (lists what gets imported)
- Emphasizes ease (no manual work)
- Simple language
- Concrete outcome

**Bad Example:**
> "Utilizing advanced GraphQL API integration with Shopify's Admin API 2025-10, our system performs optimized batch operations with intelligent change detection algorithms to synchronize your shop's data schema through automated webhook subscriptions..."

**Why It's Bad:**
- Too technical (GraphQL, webhooks, schemas)
- Jargon-heavy
- Doesn't explain benefit
- Confusing for non-technical readers
