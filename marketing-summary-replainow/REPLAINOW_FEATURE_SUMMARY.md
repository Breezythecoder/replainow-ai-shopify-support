# ReplAInow - Feature Summary for Shopify Merchants

## What is ReplAInow?

ReplAInow is an AI-powered helpdesk built specifically for Shopify stores. It's designed to handle customer support across live chat and email—automatically, intelligently, and professionally.

Unlike traditional helpdesks that require hours of setup and constant maintenance, ReplAInow works right out of the box. Install it once, and the AI instantly knows everything about your shop: your products, policies, orders, and customers. It responds to questions in any language, 24/7, and knows exactly when to hand off complex issues to your human team.

Whether you're a small shop handling 10 conversations a day or a growing business managing hundreds, ReplAInow scales with you. The AI handles 60-80% of support tickets automatically, freeing your team to focus on the conversations that truly need a human touch.

## The Foundation: AI Knowledge System

### What It Does

The moment you install ReplAInow, the AI automatically imports your entire Shopify catalog—products, orders, customers, collections, pages, policies, and blog articles. No configuration files to create. No knowledge bases to build manually. No maintenance required.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Imports your complete product catalog with variants, prices, and inventory levels
- Syncs customer order history from the last 60 days
- Loads all shop policies (returns, shipping, privacy, terms of service)
- Processes content pages, FAQs, sizing guides, and blog posts
- Updates automatically in real-time whenever you change anything in Shopify

### Why This Matters

Traditional helpdesks require you to manually build knowledge bases—typing out FAQs, creating help articles, and updating product information by hand. With ReplAInow, you skip all of that. The AI already knows everything because it reads your shop data directly from Shopify.

When a customer asks "Do you have this dress in size M?" or "What's your return policy?" the AI doesn't guess—it knows the answer because it has your actual shop data.

**Real-Time Synchronization:** Update a product price in Shopify? The AI knows within seconds. Add a new return policy? The AI starts using it immediately. Change inventory levels? The AI reflects that in customer conversations. You maintain your shop in one place (Shopify), and ReplAInow stays perfectly synchronized.

## Live Chat Support

- **Chats Tab** - Conversation history, so customers can continue previous discussions

**Customer Journey Intelligence:**
The AI knows what pages customers visited, what they added to their cart, how long they browsed, and which products caught their attention. This context makes responses incredibly relevant and personalized.

### For Your Team: Professional Agent Dashboard

Your support team gets a clean, powerful 3-column dashboard similar to Zendesk or Intercom.

**Conversation Management:**

- Sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, or frustrated)
- AI confidence score

**AI Collaboration:**

### Proactive Chat

Don't wait for customers to ask—reach out first.

**Behavioral Triggers:**
- Welcome messages when customers land on your homepage
- Product page assistance after they browse for 30 seconds
- Cart abandonment messages offering help or discounts
- Checkout assistance for customers who seem stuck
- Flash sale announcements that auto-open the widget

**Flexible Configuration:**
Each trigger lets you set the fire conditions (which pages, after how many seconds), frequency (once per session or always), and priority (if multiple triggers match). Create unlimited triggers for different scenarios.

### News Feed

Keep customers informed with announcements right in the chat widget.

**Use Cases:**
- Announce sales and promotions (🔥 Black Friday - 70% OFF Everything!)

Each news item supports images, links, publish dates, expiry dates, and priority sorting. Customers see the latest news on the Home tab every time they open the widget.

## Email Support

### Thread-Based Email Management

ReplAInow includes a complete email helpdesk with Gmail-style threading, rich text editing, and powerful AI assistance.

**Dashboard Views:**
- **Inbox** - All email threads
- **Unassigned** - Threads not yet assigned to an agent (action required)
- **My Tickets** - Your personal queue
- **Review Queue** - AI responses that need verification before sending
- **Auto-Sent** - Quality monitoring view for AI-sent emails

### How AI Handles Email

When a customer sends an email, the AI reads it, understands the intent, and decides on the best approach:

**Scenario 1: AI Can Fully Resolve**
Simple questions get instant, accurate answers. The AI responds immediately with information from your shop data. Example: "What's your return policy?" → AI quotes your actual Shopify policy.

**Scenario 2: AI Collects Missing Information**
If a customer wants a refund but didn't provide their order number, the AI asks targeted questions to gather everything needed before handing off to your team. Example: "I'd be happy to help with your refund! What's your order number?" This ensures your team gets complete information instead of playing email ping-pong.

**Scenario 3: All Info Collected, Agent Must Act**
Once the AI has everything needed (order number, customer preference, photos of damage, etc.), it writes a professional handoff email confirming all details and sets realistic expectations. Your agent sees a complete summary and knows exactly what to do.

### AI Quality Scoring

Every AI response gets a quality score (0-100) across five dimensions: response quality, context coverage, information accuracy, language fluency, and overall confidence.

**Auto-Send Configuration:**
- **90-100 (Excellent)** - Auto-sent automatically
- **80-89 (Good)** - Auto-sent if threshold set to 80 or lower
- **70-79 (Fair)** - Sent to Review Queue for agent verification
- **Below 70** - Always requires agent rewrite

You control the threshold. Set it to 90 for conservative (fewer auto-sends, more human review), or 80 for balanced (more automation, faster responses).

### Email Features for Agents

**Rich Text Editor:**
- Full HTML formatting (bold, italic, lists, links)
- Attachments up to 25 MB per file
- CC and BCC fields for professional email management
- Draft auto-save every 10 seconds

**AI Draft Handling:**
When AI creates a draft response, agents can:
- Send as-is (one click)
- Edit before sending (use AI as starting point)
- Discard and write fresh response

**Order Management Integration:**
If a customer mentions an order number, ReplAInow automatically loads the full order details in the sidebar. Agents can:
- View order products, shipping address, and tracking
- Process refunds directly from the dashboard
- Cancel orders or line items
- Update shipping addresses

**Information Collection Intelligence:**
The AI extracts phone numbers, callback times, and order numbers from emails (context-aware—it knows if "12345" is a phone number or order number based on conversation flow). Agents see collected information highlighted in the sidebar, ready to use.

**Result:** Faster response times, happier customers, and your team focuses on high-value conversations.

### Real-Time Across All Channels

Changes in Shopify sync to ReplAInow within seconds. Order shipped? Tracking updates immediately. Product out of stock? AI stops recommending it. Policy updated? AI uses the new version.

### Intelligent Handoffs

The AI knows when it can't help. When a customer is frustrated, when a question is too complex, or when manual action is required, the AI smoothly hands off to your team with complete context. Your agents see exactly what was discussed, what information was collected, and what needs to be done.

**No information loss. No asking customers to repeat themselves.**

### Multi-Language Support

The AI automatically detects the customer's language and responds fluently in over 100 languages. German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Arabic—whatever your customers speak.

- Product cards with images, prices, and "View Product" buttons

### Enterprise-Quality AI

The AI doesn't just guess—it reasons through every conversation:
- Reads full conversation history
- Checks order status and inventory
- Searches policies and content pages
- Understands customer emotion and urgency
- Scores its own response quality

When AI uncertainty is high, it escalates to humans. When confidence is high, it sends immediately. The result: accurate, professional responses that maintain your brand reputation.
